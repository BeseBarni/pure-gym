# ADR 003: Omission of Redis (Distributed Caching) for V1

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Standard microservices architectures often include Redis for distributed caching or session management. However, our current requirement is to support a 0-24 system that will scale to roughly 10 gyms. Complexity reduction is a priority for V1.

## Decision
We will **exclude Redis** from the V1 architecture.

* **State Management:** The `PureGym.API` will be deployed as a single instance for the foreseeable future. Any necessary caching will be handled via in-memory caching (`IMemoryCache` in .NET).
* **Session:** Stateless authentication (JWT via Google OAuth2) removes the need for a distributed session store.

## Consequences
* **Positive:** Significantly reduced infrastructure complexity and operational overhead. One less container to manage and monitor.
* **Positive:** Lower cost of deployment.
* **Negative:** If we need to horizontally scale the API (add a second API instance), in-memory caches will be out of sync.
* **Negative:** Restarting the API clears the cache cold, potentially causing a temporary spike in DB load on startup.
