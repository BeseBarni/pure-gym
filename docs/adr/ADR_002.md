# ADR 002: PostgreSQL as Primary Persistence Store

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The system requires structured data storage for users, memberships, access rights, and gym configurations. The data is highly relational (Users belong to Gyms, have multiple Tickets, etc.). We are using .NET with Entity Framework Core.

## Decision
We will use **PostgreSQL** as the primary relational database.

* **Schema Evolution:** We will use EF Core Migrations to manage schema changes.
* **Containerization:** The database will run as a Docker container within the system boundary for the V1 deployment.

## Consequences
* **Positive:** Strong ACID compliance, which is critical for membership and payment status.
* **Positive:** Excellent compatibility with .NET Aspire/EF Core.
* **Negative:** Scaling writes vertically eventually hits a limit, though for the projected scope (10-20 gyms), a single instance is sufficient.
